# Lexicographically Smallest Palindrome

## Problem Description

Given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters, your task is to make `s` a palindrome with the minimum number of operations possible. In one operation, you can replace a character in `s` with another lowercase English letter.

If there are multiple palindromes that can be made using the minimum number of operations, make the lexicographically smallest one.

Return the resulting palindrome string.

## Function Signature

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string makeSmallestPalindrome(string s);
};
```

## Parameters

- `s`: A string consisting of lowercase English letters

## Return Value

- Returns the lexicographically smallest palindrome string after performing the minimum number of operations

## Algorithm

The `makeSmallestPalindrome` function uses the following approach:

1. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start and end of the string, respectively.
2. Compare the characters at the `left` and `right` positions.
3. If the characters are different, replace both with the lexicographically smaller one.
4. Move the `left` pointer to the right and the `right` pointer to the left.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the `left` pointer meets or crosses the `right` pointer.
6. Return the modified string, which is now the lexicographically smallest palindrome.

## Example

Input: `s = "egcfe"`
Output: `"efcfe"`

Explanation: The minimum number of operations to make "egcfe" a palindrome is 1, and the lexicographically smallest palindrome string we can get by modifying one character is "efcfe", by changing 'g'.


## Time and Space Complexity

- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string. We iterate through half of the string once.
- Space Complexity: O(1), as we modify the string in-place and use only a constant amount of extra space.

## Notes

- The function modifies the input string in-place.
- It always produces a valid palindrome.
- The resulting palindrome is guaranteed to be the lexicographically smallest among all possible palindromes that can be formed with the minimum number of operations.

## Possible Improvements

- Add input validation to check if the string is empty.
- Implement a version that returns the number of operations performed.
- Consider adding a flag to optionally preserve the original string and return a new string instead of modifying in-place.
