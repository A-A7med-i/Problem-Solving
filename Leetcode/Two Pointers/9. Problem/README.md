# Remove Palindromic Subsequences

## Problem Description

You are given a string s consisting only of letters 'a' and 'b'. In a single step, you can remove one palindromic subsequence from s.

Return the minimum number of steps to make the given string empty.

A string is a subsequence of a given string if it is generated by deleting some characters of a given string without changing its order. Note that a subsequence does not necessarily need to be contiguous.

A string is called palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward.

## Example

Input: s = "ababa"
Output: 1
Explanation: s is already a palindrome, so its entirety can be removed in a single step.

## Approach

The solution uses a two-pointer approach to check if the entire string is a palindrome:

1. Initialize two pointers, left at the start and right at the end of the string.
2. Move the pointers towards the center, comparing characters at each step.
3. If any mismatch is found, return 2 (as we can remove all 'a's in one step and all 'b's in another).
4. If the entire string is a palindrome, return 1.

## Time Complexity

O(n), where n is the length of the string.

## Space Complexity

O(1), as we only use two pointers regardless of the string length.

## Implementation

The solution is implemented in C++ and can be found in the file `Remove Palindromic Subsequences.cpp`.

## Usage

Include the necessary headers and use the `Solution` class to call the `removePalindromeSub` function with your input string.
```cpp
Solution solution;
string s = "ababa";
int result = solution.removePalindromeSub(s);
// Print or process the result as needed
```
