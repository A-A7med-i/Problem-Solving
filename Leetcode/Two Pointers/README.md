## Two-Pointer Technique

The two-pointer technique is a powerful problem-solving strategy commonly used in LeetCode and other coding challenges. Here are the key concepts:

- **Pointers**: These are variables that store memory addresses, allowing you to efficiently traverse a data structure.
- **Coordination**: The two pointers move in a controlled manner, either approaching each other (converging) or moving in opposite directions (diverging) based on the problem requirements.
- **Iteration**: Pointers typically iterate through the data structure using loops or conditional statements.

### Benefits

- **Efficiency**: Often leads to time complexity of O(n) or better, making it suitable for large datasets.
- **Simplicity**: The logic is often straightforward and easy to understand.
- **Versatility**: Applicable to various problems involving sorting, searching, subarray manipulation, and more.
